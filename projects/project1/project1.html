	<h1>Advent of Code solution: day 11<h1>
	<p>
		This is a solution for the 'Advent of Code' problem, day 11. <br>
		There is an array of octopuses, 10 by 10. <br>  
		Each step, they increment in brightness until they reach a maximum and flash. <br>  
		This causes them to increase surrounding octopuses in brightness by one, and reset themeselves.<br>
		The question asks how many flashes occur after 40 steps.<br>  
		It then asks how many steps are required until all the octopuses flash at once.<br>  
		This is a solution for the first part, and can simply be watched to show the answer for the second part as well.<br>
